# Custom Assistants Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for adding user-created assistants to ScreenSense AI. The feature will allow users to create custom assistants with their own system prompts and a combination of pre-existing and external tools.

## Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (High Priority)

### Assistant Configuration Storage

- [ ] Create `AssistantConfig` interface for custom assistant definitions
  - Basic properties (id, name, system instruction)
  - Tool selection configuration
  - Display requirements
- [ ] Implement local storage service for assistant configurations
- [ ] Add CRUD operations for assistant configurations

### Built-in Tool Support

- [ ] Create core interfaces:
  - `ToolCategory` for organizing tools into groups
  - `ToolSelection` for managing tool enablement and configuration
  - Extend existing Google AI Tool types as needed
- [ ] Organize existing tools into categories:
  - Translation tools
  - Screen capture tools
  - Read/Write tools
  - Knowledge base tools
  - Patent tools
- [ ] Add tool selection system for assistants

### UI Components

- [ ] Create assistant creation/edit form
- [ ] Add system prompt editor
- [ ] Implement built-in tool selection interface:
  - Category-based tool organization
  - Enable/disable individual tools
  - Tool-specific configuration options
- [ ] Add basic assistant management UI (list, create, delete)

## Phase 2: External Tool Integration (High Priority)

### MCP Client Implementation

- [ ] Create MCP client for handling server connections:
  - Implement MCP handshake protocol
  - Handle version negotiation
  - Support package (feature) negotiation
  - Parse MCP messages (#$# format)
- [ ] Add connection management:
  - Connect/disconnect handling
  - Connection state monitoring
  - Reconnection logic
- [ ] Implement error handling and boundaries

### MCP Tool Integration

- [ ] Create MCP tool wrapper interface:
  - Convert MCP messages to tool format
  - Map MCP packages to tool functions
  - Handle tool lifecycle with MCP connection
- [ ] Add support for MCP tool discovery:
  - Query available packages from MCP server
  - Convert package definitions to tool definitions
- [ ] Implement tool response handling:
  - Parse MCP responses
  - Convert to assistant-compatible format
  - Handle errors and timeouts

### UI Components

- [ ] Add MCP server configuration UI:
  - Server URL input
  - Available packages display
  - Connection status indicator
- [ ] Extend assistant tool selection for MCP tools:
  - Display available MCP tools
  - Enable/disable individual MCP tools
- [ ] Add connection testing/preview functionality

## Phase 3: Cloud Integration (Medium Priority)

### User Authentication

- [ ] Implement Google Sign-In
- [ ] Store user preferences in cloud
- [ ] Handle sign-in/sign-out flows

### Cloud Storage

- [ ] Design cloud storage interface for assistants
- [ ] Implement assistant cloud sync:
  - Auto-save assistant configurations
  - Sync across devices
  - Handle offline/online states

## Phase 4: Advanced Features (Low Priority)

### Assistant Sharing

- [ ] Add assistant export/import
- [ ] Implement sharing mechanism
- [ ] Create access control system
- [ ] Add collaborative editing features
- [ ] Add marketplace functionality for sharing assistants publicly

### Version Control

- [ ] Implement assistant versioning
- [ ] Add change history tracking
- [ ] Create rollback mechanism
- [ ] Add diff visualization

## Technical Considerations

- Storage Abstraction:
  - Keep storage implementation details separate from business logic
  - Use interfaces for storage operations (local/cloud)
  - Make it easy to switch between storage backends
- Error Handling:
  - Implement proper error boundaries for MCP tools
  - Add timeout handling for external tool calls
  - Provide clear error messages to users
- UI/UX:
  - Keep UI components modular and reusable
  - Implement proper loading states
  - Add error recovery flows

## Success Metrics

- Number of custom assistants created
- External tool integration success rate
- User satisfaction with assistant creation process
- System stability with multiple external tools

## Risks and Mitigations

1. **External Tool Reliability**

   - Implement timeouts and fallbacks
   - Add monitoring for external tool performance
   - Create clear error messages for users

2. **Storage Migration**

   - Design clear data migration path
   - Implement versioning for stored configurations
   - Create backup system before migrations

## Next Steps

Begin with Phase 1 implementation
